## **What is JavaScript ?**
> ***JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.***



## ***The merits of using JavaScript are***

* **Less Server Interaction** − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.

* **Immediate feedback to the visitors** − They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.

* **Increased Interactivity** − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.

* **Richer Interfaces** − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors
